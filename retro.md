# Retrospective plans

## Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel

Team members make comments about the iteration. Comments are divided in five categories: 
- Start (new practices or things to do), 
- Stop (unnecessary or harmful practices), 
- Continue (good practices that should be kept), 
- More of (What should be done more), 
- Less of (What should be done less). 

Comments are written on a poster and then discussed.


## Glad, Sad, Mad

Team members list observations made during a sprint under categories 
- Glad (positive notes), 
- Sad (negative notes about the sprint or team) and 
- Mad (negative notes about more general issues external to the team). 

Notes are written on cards that are then placed on a whiteboard. Based on a vote, the most crucial issues are then discussed.
